Lab

For this lab, you will be building a League Point Calculator. The LPC should be able to do two things.
Let the user input scores. The user should be prompted for a final score like this: “Yankees 5 Mets 4”
User has the option to output the League Rankings based on points. From highest to lowest. If there is a tie then they should be ordered by alphabetical order.

The winner team gets 3 points. Losing team gets 0 points. If the game ends in a tie both teams get 1 point. The output should look something like this:
Yankees 9
Giants 4
Mets 4
Cardinals 0
