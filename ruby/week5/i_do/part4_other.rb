# Using everything that we have learned up to this point.
# Let’s create a Guess Who? Game (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guess_Who%3F) together.
# Your goal is to correctly identify the guilty suspect. You should have multiple classes.
# You have 3 chances.
# It should show a list of the suspects and the user are prompted to choose an attribute of hair color, eye color, skin color, or gender.
# let the user enter a color/gender.
# If guilty suspect doesn’t match the color/gender then remove the suspects of that color/gender
