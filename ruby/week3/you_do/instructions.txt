Build an application that can encrypt and decrypt a string. For example:

encrypt(“This is a secret”)
should return something like “jhsdakha%j3jb”

You should also be able to decrypt the encrypted message.


decrypt(“jhsdakha%j3jb”)
it should return “This is a secret”



Bonus: Implement a Caesar Cipher encryption which is a simple encryption method by shifting the letters down a certain number. You’ll need the encrypted string and the correct number shifted.
encrypt(“this is a secret”, 5)
