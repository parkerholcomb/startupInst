# Make a ruby program that uses puts to print the following text:
#
# “You’re a traveler on a long journey. After many miles, you come to a fork in the road. To the North is a small village.  To the East is dark cave. Which way do you go? North or East?”
#
# Then use gets to store the user’s answer in a variable called direction.
#
# Then use the direction variable in an if/else conditional:
# What happens when the user chooses North?
# What happens when the user chooses East?
