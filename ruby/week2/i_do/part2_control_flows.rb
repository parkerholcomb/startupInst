########## Control Flows ##########

  Ruby compiler reads and executes each line, one by one

  if you do not want every line to run, you need to use control statements

  # or comment that line out
  # NOTE - comments in ruby are only for us humans

  $ cd executable
  $ ruby whats_your_name.rb


########## LOGICAL OPERATORS ##########

  $ irb

  # AND
  > true && true

  # OR
  > true || false

########## WHILE ##########

examples - what will this print out?

  number = 0
  while number < 10
    puts number
    number += 1
  end

#NOTE you can also get out of a loop with the reserve word break

#NOTE you can quit a loop with Ctrl+C
