For the lab this week, extend the capabilities of the Blackjack game. There are three tasks.

Player should be asked to enter their name.
Add the ability for the player to have a bank roll.
Allow the Player to wager an amount on the game.

Extra credit: Keep the game going until the Player has no more money in his bankroll or if he says exit.

IF you'd like to see a really advanced version look this version built by Colin, an instructor in New-York:
